## SpaceX Launch Schedule

Using this SpaceX API, create an Angular application that shows a list of SpaceX launches in a sortable (by launch order) grid. The user should be able to page through the results. The columns of the grid should be Flight Number, Launch Year, Rocket Name, and Details. For a given launch, the user should be able to click on the row to navigate to the presskit for that launch using the url provided in the API response.

### Getting Started

`npm run start`

Starts the application using a local server, accessible at `localhost:4200`

`npm run test`

Runs the application test suite
